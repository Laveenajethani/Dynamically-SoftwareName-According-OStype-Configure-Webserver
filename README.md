# Dynamically SoftwareName Take According OStype and Configure Webserver

#### I have two traget nodes one traget node is running in my local VM which is redhat8 and another trarget node in running in the AWS cloud service ec2 this traget node is Ubuntu OS .

## This target node 1 : Redhat OS

## In controller node I have inventory file in which I have mentioned the target node IP and other information

In my second target node ansible login using SSH with the ubuntu user power but some task will perform using root power so in my inventory file I have mentioned the keyword [privilege_escalation] .

#### In my target node I want to configure the webserver so target nodes are redhat and ubuntu OS so apache webserver software name is different for both the OS so  my ansible playbook will dynamically take software name according to OS type for this I have created two files RedHat.yml & Debian.yml .

## Debian.yml (for ubuntu OS)

## RedHat.yml (for RedHat OS)

## For configuring webserver : Web Page : index.html
Ansible using jinja templates so in the index.html file I have given {{content}} variable for loading the content of the web page this content will taken from the RedHat.yml and Debian.yml file
